## 📊 Project Description

The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** analyzes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across the world. Using publicly available data from **Our World in Data**, this project demonstrates:

- Time-series analysis of cases and deaths
- Vaccination progress comparison between countries
- Country-wise trend comparison
- Geographical visualization (optional choropleth map)
- Extraction of meaningful insights and trends

📈 Insights & Reflections

- The United States consistently had the highest number of confirmed cases.
- India experienced major spikes, especially during the Delta variant wave.
- Kenya maintained relatively low confirmed case numbers but had slower vaccination progress.
- Vaccination rollouts in Germany and the US significantly improved death rates over time.
- Countries with early and rapid vaccine adoption showed a decline in death rates, highlighting vaccine effectiveness.
